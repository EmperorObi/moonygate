## üîÑ Update Log

### üìÅ File: `/api/auth/register/route.ts`

**Date:** 2025-06-17
**Optimized by:** Emperor

#### ‚úÖ Summary of Changes

* Implemented `Zod` validation schema to sanitize and verify request payloads.
* Introduced better error handling with specific messaging for `auth/email-already-exists`.
* Used Firebase Admin SDK methods with safety guards.
* Added Firestore user profile creation after successful Auth registration.
* Implemented fallback for failed Firestore writes (commented out `deleteUser` for manual control).
* Included user metadata such as role, status, timestamps.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Benefits

* Stronger backend validation.
* Better DX and testability.
* Consistent Auth/Firestore state sync.
* Safer onboarding for new contributors or junior devs.

### üìÅ File: `src/app/test/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Date:** 2025-06-20
**Added by:** Emperor

#### ‚úÖ Summary of Changes

* Created a **Test Dashboard** React component with **POST** and **GET** buttons to interact with `/api/test/firestore-test`.
* Added form inputs for `name` and `email`, loading states, and JSON response display.
* Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling, including responsive grid layout and buttons.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Benefits

* Provides a visual interface for manually testing API endpoints.
* Eliminates the need to use `curl` or PowerShell for basic sanity checks.
* Improves DX for frontend and backend developers to rapidly verify data flow.

### üìÅ LLM Orchestration & Pipeline Setup

**Date:** 2025-06-20
**Documented by:** Emperor

#### üõ†Ô∏è Foundations Laid (Earlier Chats)

1. **Environment & Admin SDK**
   * Structured `.env.local` for both Production ADC (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) and local Emulator connections (`FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST`, `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST`).
   * Refactored `lib/firebase/firebaseAdmin.ts` to use `applicationDefault()` and singleton `db` instance, eliminating duplicate `.settings()` calls.
2. **API Testing Harness**
   * Created `/api/test/firestore-test` route with **POST** and **GET** handlers for Firestore reads/writes.
   * Verified end‚Äëto‚Äëend with PowerShell and `curl.exe`, then built a **Test Dashboard** (`src/app/test/dashboard/page.tsx`) for visual validation.
3. **Error Handling & UX**
   * Resolved Next.js build errors (`<Html>` import, Dialog accessibility, port conflicts) to ensure a stable dev environment.

#### ‚úÖ Detailed Orchestration Steps

1. **Genkit Client Initialization** (`src/ai/genkit.ts`)
   * Instantiated Genkit with `googleAI()` plugin pointing at `googleai/gemini-2.0-flash`.
   * Ensured central export `ai` for all AI flow invocations.

2. **Webhook Endpoints** (`src/app/api/ai/callbacks/*`)
   - **report-processed**
     * Validates ingestion results (`ReportProcessedCallbackSchema`).
     * Updates `reports/{reportId}` with ingestion status, structuredDataUrl, and timestamp.
     * Marks document for next-phase analysis (e.g., `READY_FOR_ANALYSIS_EXTERNAL`).
   - **analysis-complete**
     * Parses analysis summary, recommendations, and dispute letters via `AnalysisCompleteCallbackSchema`.
     * Batches updates: embeds summary in `reports/{reportId}`, writes each letter to `disputeLetters` collection, and stamps error or completion states.
   - **dispute-status-update**
     * Validates dispute status changes (`DisputeStatusUpdateCallbackSchema`).
     * Updates existing `disputeLetters/{disputeId}` document with new status, details, and external references.

3. **Event‚ÄëDriven Workflow**
   1. **Initiation**: Client or Cloud Function invokes `ai.run('ingest-flow', { reportUrl, reportId, userId })`.
   2. **Ingestion**: External service processes raw report, calls `/report-processed` callback.
   3. **Analysis**: On successful ingestion, trigger `ai.run('analysis-flow', { reportId, structuredDataUrl })` and await `/analysis-complete`.
   4. **Dispute Generation & Tracking**: Dispute letters created & stored, then external systems push status updates to `/dispute-status-update`.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Benefits & Next Milestones

* **Robust Validation**: Zod schemas enforce strict contracts on each webhook.
* **Idempotent & Secure**: Planned API‚Äëkey stubs guard endpoints, with idempotency checks to handle retries.
* **Local Fidelity**: Firebase Emulators replicate production Firestore, Auth, and Functions for confident testing.
* **Scalable Pipeline**: Clear separation of phases eases maintenance and future extension (e.g., notifications, retries, analytics).

**Next Steps:**
* Wire up **`ai.run(...)` triggers** in callbacks to automate phase transitions.
* Implement **notification microservice** (email, SMS, push) for user alerts.
* Develop **integration tests** with mocks for external AI/Python flows.
* Continue extending orchestration documentation tomorrow.
